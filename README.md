# zk-Reddit Community Rewards Aggregator: a Proof-of-Concept

The Ethos project envisions a future where user identities are both private and empowering. This PoC aims to illustrate a simple use case:
(1) allow users to securely link their Reddit communities
(2) enable third parties to reward users based on their communities, without knowing individual identities.

## Objective

1. Connect with Reddit: Fetch and link user community memberships.
2. Integrate zk-SNARKs: Use zero-knowledge proofs to balance user privacy with the disclosure of community details.
3. Enable Third-Party Rewards: Allows brands to reward communities in a privacy-preserving manner.
